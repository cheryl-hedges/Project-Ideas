# Project-Ideas
Hey have an idea for a Project?  Post it on the [issues](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/Project-Ideas/issues) page!

This space is an open forum for people to propose project ideas, be it something cool they really want to build or some problem in the city you think can be fixed.

If you want to know more steps for starting a project check the guide [here] (http://codeforsanjose.com/how-to-start-a-project/) or talk with an officer like vivek@codeforsanjose.com.
